name: Unyielding Onyx Assault Ring
description: "This formidable ring is a testament to the power of the ancient Onyx gem it holds at its center. The gem, as dark as a moonless night, radiates an eerie yet captivating violet glow, hinting at the latent power contained within. Encasing the Onyx gem is a band of intricately engraved blackened steel, adorned with etchings of fierce, snarling beasts in the midst of battle. The ring is warm to the touch, and seems to pulse with a faint energy."
